PART II. OF TRUTH.
SECTION I.
GENERAL PRINCIPLES RESPECTING IDEAS OF TRUTH.
Chapter I., Of Ideas of Truth in their connection with those of Beauty and Relation
§  1.	The two great ends of landscape painting are the representation of facts and thoughts.	44
§  2.	They induce a different choice of material subjects.[Page lvi]	45
§  3.	The first mode of selection apt to produce sameness and repetition.	45
§  4.	The second necessitating variety.	45
§  5.	Yet the first is delightful to all.	46

§  7.	The first necessary to the second.	47
§  8.	The exceeding importance of truth.	48
§  9.	Coldness or want of beauty no sign of truth.	48
§ 10.	How truth may be considered a just criterion of all art.	48
Chapter II., That the Truth of Nature is not to be discerned by the Uneducated Senses
§  1.	The common self-deception of men with respect to their power of discerning truth.	50
§  2.	Men usually see little of what is before their eyes.	51
§  3.	But more or less in proportion to their natural sensibility to what is beautiful.	52
§  4.	Connected with a perfect state of moral feeling.	52
§  5.	And of the intellectual powers.	53
§  6.	How sight depends upon previous knowledge.	54
§  7.	The difficulty increased by the variety of truths in nature.	55

Chapter III., Of the Relative Importance of Truths:—First, that Particular Truths are more important than General Ones.
§  1.	Necessity of determining the relative importance of truths.	58
§  2.	Misapplication of the aphorism: "General truths are more important than particular ones."	58
§  3.	Falseness of this maxim, taken without explanation.	59
§  4.	Generality important in the subject, particularity in the predicate.	59
§  5.	The importance of truths of species is not owing to their generality.	60
§  6.	All truths valuable as they are characteristic.	61
§  7.	Otherwise truths of species are valuable, because beautiful.	61
§  8.	And many truths, valuable if separate, may be objectionable in connection with others.	62

Chapter IV., Of the Relative Importance of Truths:—Secondly, that Rare Truths are more important than Frequent Ones
§  1.	No accidental violation of nature's principles should be represented.	64

§  3.	Color is a secondary quality, therefore less important than form.	68
§  4.	Color no distinction between objects of the same species.	68
§  5.	And different in association from what it is alone.	69

OF GENERAL TRUTHS.
Chapter I., Of Truth of Tone
§  1.	Meanings of the word "tone:"—First, the right relation of objects in shadow to the principal light.	140
§  2.	Secondly, the quality of color by which it is felt to owe part of its brightness to the hue of light upon it.	140
§  3.	Difference between tone in its first sense and aerial perspective.	141
§  4.	The pictures of the old masters perfect in relation of middle tints to light.	141
§  5.	And consequently totally false in relation of middle tints to darkness.	141

§  8.	Comparison of N. Poussin's "Phocion."	144
§  9.	With Turner's "Mercury and Argus."	145
§ 10.	And with the "Datur Hora Quieti."	145
§ 11.	The second sense of the word "tone."	146
§ 12.	Remarkable difference in this respect between the paintings and drawings of Turner.	146
§ 13.	Not owing to want of power over the material.	146
§ 14.	The two distinct qualities of light to be considered.	147
§ 15.	Falsehoods by which Titian attains the appearance of quality in light.	148
§ 16.	Turner will not use such means.	148
§ 17.	But gains in essential truth by the sacrifice.	148
§ 18.	The second quality of light.	148
§ 19.	The perfection of Cuyp in this respect interfered with by numerous solecisms.	150
§ 20.	Turner is not so perfect in parts—far more so in the whole.	151
§ 21.	The power in Turner of uniting a number of tones.	152

§ 19.	His drawings invariably perfect.	171
§ 20.	The subjection of his system of color to that of chiaroscuro.	171
Chapter III., Of Truth of Chiaroscuro
§  1.	We are not at present to examine particular effects of light.	174
§  2.	And therefore the distinctness of shadows is the chief means of expressing vividness of light.	175
§  3.	Total absence of such distinctness in the works of the Italian school.	175
§  4.	And partial absence in the Dutch.	176
§  5.	The perfection of Turner's works in this respect.	177

§ 13.	The truth of Turner.	183
Chapter IV., Of Truth of Space:—First, as Dependent on the Focus of the Eye
§  1.	Space is more clearly indicated by the drawing of objects than by their hue.	185
§  2.	It is impossible to see objects at unequal distances distinctly at one moment.	186
§  3.	Especially such as are both comparatively near.	186
§  4.	In painting, therefore, either the foreground or distance must be partially sacrificed.	187
§  5.	Which not being done by the old masters, they could not express space.	187
§  6.	But modern artists have succeeded in fully carrying out this principle.	188
§  7.	Especially of Turner.	189
§  8.	Justification of the want of drawing in Turner's figures.	189
Chapter V., Of Truth of Space:—Secondly, as its Appearance is dependent on the Power of the Eye
§  1.	The peculiar indistinctness dependent on the retirement of objects from the eye.	191
§  2.	Causes confusion, but not annihilation of details.	191
§  3.	Instances in various objects.	192
§  4.	Two great resultant truths; that nature is never distinct, and never vacant.	193
§  5.	Complete violation of both these principles by the old masters. They are either distinct or vacant.	193

§  8.	And G. Poussin.	195
§  9.	The imperative necessity, in landscape painting, of fulness and finish.	196

§ 15.	Still greater fulness and finish in landscape foregrounds.	200
§ 16.	Space and size are destroyed alike by distinctness and by vacancy.	202
§ 17.	Swift execution best secures perfection of details.	202
§ 18.	Finish is far more necessary in landscape than in historical subjects.	202
§ 19.	Recapitulation of the section.	203
SECTION III., OF TRUTH OF SKIES
Chapter I., Of the Open Sky.
§  1.	The peculiar adaptation of the sky to the pleasing and teaching of man.	204
§  2.	The carelessness with which its lessons are received.	205
§  3.	The most essential of these lessons are the gentlest.	205
§  4.	Many of our ideas of sky altogether conventional.	205
§  5.	Nature, and essential qualities of the open blue.	206
§  6.	Its connection with clouds.	207
§  7.	Its exceeding depth.	207
§  8.	These qualities are especially given by modern masters.	207
§  9.	And by Claude.	208
§ 10.	Total absence of them in Poussin. Physical errors in his general treatment of open sky.	208
§ 11.	Errors of Cuyp in graduation of color.	209
§ 12.	The exceeding value of the skies of the early Italian and Dutch schools. Their qualities are unattainable in modern times.	210
§ 13.	Phenomena of visible sunbeams. Their nature and cause.	211
§ 14.	They are only illuminated mist, and cannot appear when the sky is free from vapor, nor when it is without clouds.	211
§ 15.	Erroneous tendency in the representation of such phenomena by the old masters.	212
§ 16.	The ray which appears in the dazzled eye should not be represented.	213
§ 17.	The practice of Turner. His keen perception of the more delicate phenomena of rays.	213
§ 18.	The total absence of any evidence of such perception in the works of the old masters.	213
§ 19.	Truth of the skies of modern drawings.	214
§ 20.	Recapitulation. The best skies of the ancients are, in quality, inimitable, but in rendering of various truth, childish.	215

§  6.	Their number.	218
§  7.	Causes of their peculiarly delicate coloring.	219
§  8.	Their variety of form.	219
§  9.	Total absence of even the slightest effort at their representation, in ancient landscape.	220
§ 10.	The intense and constant study of them by Turner.	221
§ 11.	His vignette, Sunrise on the Sea.	222
§ 12.	His use of the cirrus in expressing mist.	223

§ 14.	The color of the upper clouds.	224
§ 15.	Recapitulation.	225
Chapter III., Of Truth of Clouds:—Secondly, of the Central Cloud Region
§  1.	Extent and typical character of the central cloud region.	226
§  2.	Its characteristic clouds, requiring no attention nor thought for their representation, are therefore favorite subjects with the old masters.	226
§  3.	The clouds of Salvator and Poussin.	227
§  4.	Their essential characters.	227
§  5.	Their angular forms and general decision of outline.	228
§  6.	The composition of their minor curves.	229
§  7.	Their characters, as given by S. Rosa.	230
§  8.	Monotony and falsehood of the clouds of the Italian school generally.	230
§  9.	Vast size of congregated masses of cloud.	231
§ 10.	Demonstrable by comparison with mountain ranges.	231
§ 11.	And consequent divisions and varieties of feature.	232
§ 12.	Not lightly to be omitted.	232
§ 13.	Imperfect conceptions of this size and extent in ancient landscape.	233
§ 14.	Total want of transparency and evanescence in the clouds of ancient landscape.	234
§ 15.	Farther proof of their deficiency in space.	235
§ 16.	Instance of perfect truth in the sky of Turner's Babylon.	236
§ 17.	And in his Pools of Solomon.	237
§ 18.	Truths of outline and character in his Como.	237
§ 19.	Association of the cirrostratus with the cumulus.	238

§ 21.	Farther principles of cloud form exemplified in his Amalfi.	239
§ 22.	Reasons for insisting on the infinity of Turner's works. Infinity is almost an unerring test of all truth[Page lxiv]	239
§ 23.	Instances of the total want of it in the works of Salvator.	240
§ 24.	And of the universal presence of it in those of Turner. The conclusions which may be arrived at from it.	240
§ 25.	The multiplication of objects, or increase of their size, will not give the impression of infinity, but is the resource of novices.	241
§ 26.	Farther instances of infinity in the gray skies of Turner.	242
§ 27.	The excellence of the cloud-drawing of Stanfield.	242
§ 28.	The average standing of the English school.	243
Chapter IV.,Of Truth of Clouds:—Thirdly, of the Region of the Rain-Cloud.
§  1.	The apparent difference in character between the lower and central clouds is dependent chiefly on proximity.	244
§  2.	Their marked differences in color.	244
§  3.	And in definiteness of form.	245
§  4.	They are subject to precisely the same great laws.	245
§  5.	Value, to the painter, of the rain-cloud.	246
§  6.	The old masters have not left a single instance of the painting of the rain-cloud, and very few efforts at it. Gaspar Poussin's storms.	247
§  7.	The great power of the moderns in this respect.	248
§  8.	Works of Copley Fielding.	248
§  9.	His peculiar truth.	248
§ 10.	His weakness, and its probable cause.	249
§ 11.	Impossibility of reasoning on the rain-clouds of Turner from engravings.	250

§ 19.	Compared with forms given by Salvator.	254
§ 20.	Entire expression of tempest by minute touches and circumstances in the Coventry.	255
§ 21.	Especially by contrast with a passage of extreme repose.	255

§ 26.	Contrasted with Gaspar Poussin's rain-cloud in the Dido and Æneas.	258
§ 27.	Turner's power of rendering mist.	258
§ 28.	His effects of mist so perfect, that if not at once understood, they can no more be explained or reasoned on than nature herself.	259
§ 29.	Various instances.	259
§ 30.	Turner's more violent effects of tempest are never rendered by engravers.	260
§ 31.	General system of landscape engraving.	260
§ 32.	The storm in the Stonehenge.	260
§ 33.	General character of such effects as given by Turner. His expression of falling rain.	261
§ 34.	Recapitulation of the section.	261
§ 35.	Sketch of a few of the skies of nature, taken as a whole, compared with the works of Turner and of the old masters. Morning on the plains.	262

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
